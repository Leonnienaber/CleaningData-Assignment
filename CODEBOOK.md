## Introduction

This document serves as the README file for the following project assignment:

Course:	Obtaining and Cleaning Data  
Assignement: Peer-graded Assignment  
Reference:

[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a 
Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

### Feature selection for assignment

The information for the assignement can be drawn from 7 different tables/datasets of the original set (included below) namely:

  1. Activity labels 			(Named: "activity_labels")
  2. Dataset for test features		(Named: "X_test)
  3. Dataset for train features		(Named: "X_train)
  4. List for test subjects (1-30)	(Named: "subject_test)
  5. List for train subjects (1-30)	(Named: "subject_train)
  6. Activity class label for test (1-6)	(Named: "y_test)
  7. Activity class label for train (1-6)	(Named: "y_test)

#####Notes:
* Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
* Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

###Dataset generated by the script

```AverageTable.txt```

* Question 5's table. 
* This tidy table contains the average of each variable grouped by each activity and each subject

###Transformation

The tranformation of the data can be read in the README.md file

### Description of variables
```AverageTable.txt```

* ActivityName
    + This is the activity the subject performed during the experimental setup and data recording.
    + WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING 
* PersonID	
    + Subjects 1-30
* Listed below	
    + 66 other variables as listed below. The description of each word in the variable has the same meaning as in the original data 
		+ Time - Time domain signals
		* Freq - Frequncy domain signals
		* Mean - The mean was recorded for the feature
		* Std - The standard deviation was recorded for each feature
		* X,Y,Z - This denote the 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
